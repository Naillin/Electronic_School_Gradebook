For the application to work, you need to create a database. The database assembly code is attached in the description called: DB_Electronic_School_Gradebook2.sql.
When starting the program, at the very beginning you will need to configure connections. To do this, there is a connection settings button in the lower right corner. (By default, a connection is set to be protected by a login and password. Erase the "User Id" fields and "Password" and click the “Apply” button)
